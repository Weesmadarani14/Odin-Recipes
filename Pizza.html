<p>This Quick and Easy Pizza Dough requires just 10 minutes of work! Top with your favorite toppings, bake and you can have homemade pizza in 30 minutes! </p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 ½ to 2 cups all purpose flour 195g (plus more for rolling)</li>
    <li>1 package instant or quick yeast (2 ¼ teaspoons)</li>
    <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon granulated sugar</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
    <li>2/3 cup warm water</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons oil</li>
</ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>If baking immediately, preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Lightly grease a perforated pizza pan.</li>
    <li>In a medium bowl, stir together 1 cup of flour, yeast, salt, sugar, oregano and garlic.</li>
    <li>Add water and oil and stir until combined — it will be a very wet dough.</li>
    <li>Add just enough of the remaining flour so that a soft but not sticky dough forms. Add the flour gradually and knead briefly until combined so that you can feel when it is ready — it will still be soft (not feel firm or tough) but won’t stick to your hands. To knead, simply press the flour into the dough, fold the dough and press, fold and press.</li>
    <li>Set covered in a warm, draft-free place to rise or bake immediately for thin crust pizza.</li>
    <li>To bake: roll dough out to fit a 12-15″ pizza pan. Place dough circle on pan and stretch with your hands to reach the edges. Top with sauce, cheese and toppings.</li>
    <li>Bake at 425 degrees F for 12-15 minutes until desired crispness is reached. Broil for 1-2 minutes to brown the cheese if desired.</li>
</ol>
